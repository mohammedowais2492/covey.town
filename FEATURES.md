# Problem Statement: 
Our proposed feature is to “Add text chat and direct messaging” in Covey.Town. The UI currently allows the video chat feature but having text chat and direct messaging is something vital to a multiplayer game such as Covey.Town. Like in the Zoom video app, we are planning to have both group chat and direct chat feature in the current UI of Covey.Town.

We are interested in the feature because it will enhance the user experience of the game as not everyone who plays the game wishes to interact with other players via video chats. Text chats are more intuitive and easier. This feature will also allow users to form groups, modify or delete sent texts and direct message any online player in a room.
