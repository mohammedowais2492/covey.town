# Problem Statement: 
Our proposed feature is to “Add text chat and direct messaging” in Covey.Town. The UI currently allows the video chat feature but having text chat and direct messaging is something vital to a multiplayer game such as Covey.Town. Like in the Zoom video app, we are planning to have both group chat and direct chat feature in the current UI of Covey.Town.

We are interested in the feature because it will enhance the user experience of the game as not everyone who plays the game wishes to interact with other players via video chats. Text chats are more intuitive and easier. This feature will also allow users to form groups, modify or delete sent texts and direct message any online player in a room.

## Features

#### Feature 1 (Chat with All players/Group Chat):

1. Create and Join a new room or an existing one.
2. Send and receive texts in the chat to all online players (dropdown list should be set to **Everyone**) using the chatbox at the right hand corner of the screen. The dropdown list can be found at the top of the chatbox section.
3. A window to chat with all the players in the room should be present on right side of the map.

#### Feature 2 (Chat with one nearby player): 

1. Create and Join a new room or an existing one.
2. Select a particular player to direct message.
3. Send and receive text in the chat to one particular online player.
4. When a user gets in proximity of another player, the nearby players section shows the player's name as a clickable button in the upper part of the chatbox section.
5. Click the nearby player's button in order to send a private DM to the player visible to only sender and receiver.

#### Feature 3 (Chat with one player by choosing from dropdown list):

1. Create and Join a new room or an existing one.
2. Select a particular player in the group chat to direct message from the dropdown list.
3. Send and receive text in the chat to one particular online player.
